title: Iteration 3

## Overview

:::info Iteration 3 Goal
In this iteration, you want to aim for completing all or most of your "must have" features. **You want to make sure that by the end of this iteration your app is distinguished from other similar apps out there. **
:::

:::caution
**Your app must definitely be more than a simple CRUD app by the end of iteration 3. Do NOT work on universal features such as a Login is this iteration; instead focus on delivering the unique/specific core features of your app.** You can always add in those generic functionalities in later iterations.
:::

These are the deadlines for this iteration.

### Retrospective for iteration 2

You **must** write a _Retrospective_ for iteration 2. The retrospective is an opportunity for your team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next iteration. Review what you had done in iteration 2; note things that you have and have not delivered, note the challenges you had, and reflect on how you shall proceed in the next iteration to do a better job. There is not a specific format to the retrospective document and no minumin and/or requirements on its length, format etc. It is meant to reflect on iteration 2 and use it to improve your next iterations. Write this in a file named `it2_retrospective.md` and upload it under `docs` folder in your group repo.


### Update Requirement Specification Document

You only need to update the Requirement Specification Document if you want to make any changes to the specification of your proposed software project. That is, you can leave it as is, if you are happy with it.


### Update Class Diagram

If there has been been any changes to your desgin since last iteration, make sure to update your class diagram to reflect the latest design of your software. Upload a new class diagram picture to the `docs` folder. Make sure to include `it3` in the file name(s) e.g. _`it3_class_diagram1.png`_, _`it3_class_diagram2.png`_, etc.

:::tip
Remember that your class diagram must be kept updated at all times. (i.e., iterations)

### Project Planning: Giuthub Project Board

Similar to what you did in iteration 1 and 2, create three columns "It3-To Do" with _preset_ `To do`, "It3-In Progress" with _preset_ `In Progress`, and "It3-Done" with preset `Done`. You will need to keep the colmuns updated as you develop your app further. List all your _to do_ tasks extracted from the user stories you plan to finish for iteration 3 under the "It3-To Do" column. When you start working on a task, move it under the "It3-In Progress" column, and when it is completed list it under the "It3-Done" column. 

:::tip 
Ideally, you do not have any unfinished tasks from iteration 1 and 2. But, if there are unfinihsed tasks, move them over to the _it3_ columns and aim to get them done in this iteration.
:::

:::caution
In this iteration, it is expected that you will pick up even more speed and accomplish most (if not all) must have features.
:::


### Final Deliverable 

At the end of iteration 3, you must deliver a software that does what you have listed in the project backlog for iteration 3.

You must always keep your group repository updated with the latest changes; we will consider your **last commit to the `main` branch by Tue, Nov 2nd, 11:00 PM as your submission for this iteration.**

:::caution
If you use branching, you must make sure to merge your final work into `main`/`master` for final iteration submission!
:::

:::caution
By the end of iteration 3, you must make sure you have a runnable software; that is we must be able to run your app, test its new features and verify your progress compared to iteration 1 and 2.
:::

:::caution
Do not forget to update you project's `README.md` based on your progress/updates in iteration 3. See Piazza @196 item 5 and set up your `README.md` based on the given template!
:::


### Individual Contribution Report

Each member in the team must write a short individual report. This must be done _individually_, hence the name individual report!; you may not work on this together. This does not have to be long and there are no hard requirements on the format, length, content etc. of this document. However, you should use this to 1) reflect on your own individual performance in iteration 3, and 2) mention the names of any particular member(s) who you think excelled in the last iteration. 

:::info
This should not be the case hopefully, but if you have major concerns about performance of any other member(s) i.e. someone who is not putting in the necessary effort/time, is not committed to the team's mission etc., make a mention of it in your individual report. We will check these individual reports and we will take necessary actions if needed. Submit your individual report to your personal repo in the `jhu-oose` organization in a file named `it3_individual_report.md`.
:::

:::danger submit individual report to your private repo
We have provisioned you a personal repo at the begining of the semester and you must still have access to it (i.e. the repo you used to submit HW1). This is different from your project/team repo that you use to submit your homeworks and other iteration deliverables. **Submit the individual report to your private repo, not the team repo!**
