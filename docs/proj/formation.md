title: Team Formation
---

Each team must have 5 or 6 members. Students have freedom to choose their partners to form/join teams. The group formation process needs you to be a bit proactive, so please take action and have open conversations about your interests, technical backgrounds etc. but be considerate of each other! When deciding to to join/form a team, consider 1) the potential project area/idea you will be working on: is this something you like to be a part of and contribute to?, 2) technical background: do you feel comfortable or are you passionate about learning the set of potential technologies that will likely be used in this work? 3) Any other considerations that are important/relevant to you.

:::danger Warning!
Keep in mind that when you join a group, you make a commitment to that team! You will need to stay in that team for the semester, communicate with your teammates continuously & effectively, and contribute your fair share to the team mission (which is the project work). You cannot change teams later in the semester once you become part of a team, so make an informed decision!
