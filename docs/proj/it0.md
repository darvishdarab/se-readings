## Overview

These are the deadlines for this iteration:

|         | Day | Date         | Time     |
| ------- | --- | ------------ | -------- |
| Upload Requirement Specifications (SRS) | Tue | 9/20  |  11:00 PM  |

### Outline

In this iteration, you must finalize the team members as well as the project ideation. You would then proceed to write an initial SRS. Identify and elaborate the core features of your app as well as the more important nice-to-have features, but do not over-complicate things. Make sure your app goes beyond CRUD, but in later iterations you will have the opportunity to refine/improve the SRS. *Deciding and finalizing your software architecture and technology stack is another important step in this iteration* (make sure it is noted in the SRS).

### Submission

:::danger Submission
