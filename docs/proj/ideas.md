title: Few Suggested Ideas
---

In this page I have listed some potential project ideas based on (educational-related) problems or shortcomings of existing solutions that I see as a CS professor. This is to give you some inspiration, but if you like any of these ideas that you would like to work on as your OOSE project, feel free to talk to the course instructor!

## An Interaction Platform for Meetings
:::info Short Summary
The goal of this project is to create a [Slido](https://www.slido.com)-like web/mobile app to facilitate audience engagement/interaction with the meeting hosts through live pollings, Q&As or short quizzes, etc. The platform would allow participation of audience in these interactions both anonymously and non-anonymously. This project could be geared towards creating such a platform specifically for CS/JHU classes/meetings or even only CS @ JHU classes/meetings. 
:::

Sure, there are apps like Slido, but they either are not customized for CS/JHU and/or their free tiers are limited and do not allow much customizability.

:::tip potential clients
In general, any meeting host(s) and attendees. If geared towards JHU/CS, then JHU/CS professors and/or CS/JHU event/meeting organizers as well as JHU students and meeting attendees!

## OOSE Assistant! 

:::info Short Summary
The goal of this project is to create a web application to help OOSE staff automate some of the mundane tasks involved in class management, handling and grading. Some example tasks that this solution could help with are:

* Iteration grading workflow and feedback delivery to teams: For instance, facilitate assigning grading tasks to CAs, collect them when done and notify parties of interest (e.g., OOSE professor, team advisor, team members),.
* Course Staff coordination: Help course staff find common times for their meetings, or even individual advisors and team members to find times to meet outside class.
* Sentiment analysis or other NLP analyses on individual contribution reports, project iteration retrospectives, Github board and/or other documents to provide further insights for course staff.

:::tip potential clients
OOSE staff and students or potentially any CS "team course" that heavily uses Github.

## CA Scheduling 

:::info Short Summary
The goal of this project is to create a web/mobile application to help with course CAs (at CS at JHU) meeting and/or office hours scheduling. The app would collect every CA (or course staff) availability as well as the course schedule itself plus any particular course-specific constraints and then recommend viable schedule suggestions for staff meetings and office hours. Example for course-specific constraints would be: less weekend office hours, more day-time office hours, maximize overlapping of CA office hours closer to homework deadline days and avoid overlapping otherwise, etc. A very core feature of this app is the "scheduling algorithm" that takes all the inputs and constraints into account to suggest viable solutions.
:::

:::tip potential clients
Any (CS?) course staff at JHU or potentially other higher education institutions. This app would specially be useful for larger classes (e.g., Gateway, Intermediate Programming etc.) where many CAs work for a single course and it is often non-trivial to find optimum schedules to benefit both the students and the course staff.
