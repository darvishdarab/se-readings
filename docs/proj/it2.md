## Overview

:::info 
The overall goal in this iteration is to get a bit more done compared to the last iteration; you need to pick up pace and build momentum.

### Retrospective for iteration 1

You **must** write a _Retrospective_ for iteration 1. The retrospective is an opportunity for your team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next iteration. Review what you had done in iteration 1; note things that you have and have not delivered, note the challenges you had, and reflect on how you shall proceed in the next iteration to do a better job. There are no strict requirements on its length, format etc. It is meant to reflect on iteration 1 and use it to improve your next iterations. Write this in a file named `it1_retrospective.md` and upload it under `docs/retrospective` folder in your team repo.


### Update Requirement Specification

After [iteration 1](it1), you may want to update the SRS. **This is a common practice; after each iteration you will go back and refine the user stories.** If you are going to make a critical change (that affects the scope of your work), please make sure the instructor as well as your advisor are aware of it.

:::info
You only need to update the SRS if you want to make any changes to the specification of your proposed software project. That is, you can leave it as is, if you are happy with it and there has not been any change of plans since last iteration!
:::

### Update Class Diagram

If there has been been any changes to your desgin since last iteration, make sure to update your class diagram to reflect the latest design of your software. Upload a new class diagram picture to the `docs/design` folder. Make sure to include `it2` in the file name(s) e.g. _`it2_class_diagram1.png`_

:::tip
Remember that your class diagram must be kept updated at all times. (i.e. from iteration to iteration)
::::


### Project Planning: Giuthub Project Board

Similar to what you did in iteration 1, create three columns "It2-To Do" with _preset_ `To do`, "It2-In Progress" with _preset_ `In Progress`, and "It2-Done" with preset `Done`. You will need to keep the colmuns updated as you develop your app further. List all your _to do_ tasks extracted from the user stories you plan to finish for iteration 2 under the "It2-To Do" column. When you start working on a task, move it under the "It2-In Progress" column, and when it is completed list it under the "It2-Done" column. 

:::tip 
Ideally, you do not have any unfinished tasks from iteration 1. But, if there are unfinihsed tasks from iteration 1, move them over to the _It2-Todo_ column and aim to get them done in iteration 2.
:::

:::caution
In this iteration, it is expected that you will pick up more speed and accomplish more compared to the last iteration!
:::

:::tip
Leave iteration 1 columns there for now. We will be looking at these when giving you feedback for iteration 1 work. Once you have received feedback on iteration 1, you can leave in or remove iteration 1 columns.
:::


### Final Deliverable 

At the end of iteration 2, you must deliver a software that does what you have listed in the project backlog for iteration 2.

You must always keep your group repository updated with the latest changes. We will look at your deliverables, source code, documents, project board, desgin documents, and the history of commits to evaluate your work. We will consider your **last commit by Wed, OCT 19th, 4:00 PM as your submission.**

:::caution
By the end of iteration 2, you must make sure you have a runnable software; that is we must be able to run your app, test its new features and verify your progress compared to iteration 1.
:::

:::caution
Do not forget to update you project's `README.md` based on your progress/updates in iteration 2. Note that we ask you to stick with the `README` template file provided to you the first time you created your team repo!
:::

### Individual Contribution Report

Starting with this iteration and moving forward, each member in the team must write a short individual report. This must be done _individually_, hence the name individual report!; you may not work on this together. This does not have to be long and there are no hard requirements on the format, length, content etc. of this document. However, you should use this to 1) reflect on your own individual performance in iteration 2, and 2) mention the names of any particular member(s) who you think excelled in the last iteration. 

:::info
This should not be the case hopefully, but if you have major concerns about performance of any other member(s) i.e. someone who is not putting in the necessary effort/time, is not committed to the team's mission etc., make a mention of it in your individual report. We will check these individual reports and we will take necessary actions if needed. Go to [https://classroom.github.com/a/mjg0x4xf](https://classroom.github.com/a/mjg0x4xf) and accept the invitation to create a repo. Upload your individual report as a file named `individual_report.md` to the repo.
:::

:::danger submit individual report to your private repo
**Submit the individual report to your individual private repo created above, not the team repo!**
