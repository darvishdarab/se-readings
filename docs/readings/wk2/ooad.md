Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) is a software engineering approach that models a system as a group of interacting objects.Â 

:::info
Objects must model the behavior and state relevant to the system being implemented. Only certain properties and behavior are relevant; identifying what is relevant is a key part of OOAD.
:::

OOAD involves:

* **Analysis**, or *problem modeling*, in which the problem is described and represented.
* **Design**, or *solution modeling*, in which a solution to the problem is discovered and represented.
* **Implementation**, in which the code that makes up the working system is written and tested.

In a traditional plan-driven model (like "Waterfall") these steps are taken in order and in turn. In an agile software development model, the *incremental approach* to development is taken where at each *cycle* (iteration), you analyze *a little*, design *a little* and then code *a little*. At the end of the cycle, you receive feedback and respond to changes.

The analyze-a-little, design-a-little, code-a-little cycle is what we expect you to employ through project iterations.
