The goal of this project is to create a web application where we can create, view and search among our favorite books and authors. The app should streamline the process of adding new favorite books. Also, it should allow its users to list all the books and be able to search among them using different filters (e.g., ISBN number, author name, book title, etc.). The latter is not a must, but it would be nice to have the searching functionality. The user should also be able to list all authors in a separate view as well. Ideally, we might want to add logging in/out functionality to this app also, but that is not a priority (i.e., a nice to have feature, not a must have!)

A URL shortening service is too simple for an OOSE project (unless you add bells and whistles to it). So instead, we will ask you to build it as homework!
