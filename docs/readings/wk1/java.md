Students come to OOSE with a varied background; some students may already know several languages and/or have prior software development/engineering experience but the common denominator is just a modest programming experience in Java. As such, we will stick with Java for instruction and homework assignments.

You need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer to compile and run Java code. You can get pre-built binaries (for free) from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or directly from [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

You must download the binaries for your operating system (mine is a Windows). When it asks you to choose a JVM, I recommend choosing HotSpot which is the default VM for the OpenJDK and Oracle's Java. At the time of writing, you have the choice between JDK 8, 11 and 16 (latest). The versions 8 and 11 have long term support (LTM) so I recommend using either of those. 

The installation is fairly straight forward (keep selecting next); in case of any issues, consult this detailed [installation instruction](https://adoptopenjdk.net/installation.html).
