## Project description 
The goal of this project is to create a web application where we can view, post, and search among job posts. The app should streamline the process of adding new job posts for employers. Also, it should allow potential employees to view all job listings and be able to search among them using different filters (e.g., search keywords, job field, job type, pay range, employer etc.). Ideally, A "sign up/in" functionality would be nice (not a "must have") where only signed-in users can apply for jobs. 

:::info
We will build (parts of) this app together during the lectures in an incremental manner. This will help us to get hands-on practice with the concepts and tools we want to cover in this class. A number of homework tasks will be based on `JBApp`.
