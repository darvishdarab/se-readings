A **requirement** is a single thing that the software has to do.[^1]

[^1]: In systems engineering and requirements engineering, _functional_ requirements define what a system is supposed to do and _non-functional_ requirements define how a system is supposed to be. In OOSE, requirement means **functional** requirement. 

Requirement specification involves defining the intended functionality of the software and potential constraints on its operation.

Step one in building your software project is to understand what the requirements are.   
This phase is also called **Product Discovery**.

## The specification document

Make a [copy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xsof7GoMBMUrotWfhQoi5YFlcOT0bSS93RN3pCJ-Ukw/edit?usp=sharing) of a template for project requirement specification.

* The specification of the software system is one of the most important
 documents to connect the customer and the engineering team.

* When you're capturing the requirements for a software system, you want to 
make sure that you write down all the requirements (not missing any 
functionality that the customer actually cared about). Moreover, make sure the
requirements are consistent with one another, jotted down precisely and 
as concise as possible.
  
* It is important to keep in mind that a software specification is an
abstraction of what the system will end up being at the end. 
When you start implementing the system and get down to the lower 
level details, you'll realize that there are problems with the initial 
specification. That's okay; in fact there are often things that you couldn't 
actually have figured out in advance.

## Best Practices

* Software projects involving several people start out with very different impressions on how the app should be structured.
Your primary goal is to expand on and unify those visions into one cohesive vision.

* This happens through extensive discussing, questioning, sketching, ... All parties involved need to be at the table: management, developers, customers, ...
