# OOSE

Object-Oriented Software Engineering (or as we like to call it, OOSE) is a course about developing software that others can understand, maintain, and grow. The course goals include improving your ability to:

* Elegantly implement larger-scale software systems.
* Work effectively with a team of programmers.
* Think independently and innovatively.
* Communicate your ideas, designs, and implementations.
