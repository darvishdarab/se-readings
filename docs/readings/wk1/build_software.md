*Engineers like to solve problems. If there are no problems handily available, they will create their own problems.*
**Scott Adams**
:::

Before inventing a problem, look for a real one! 
When considering an idea for your project, ask yourself a question regarding the utility of your product. 
If youâ€™re willing to solve a real problem, you enjoy the advantage of having a real "customer" with real "expectations" and a software project with real "requirements" and "constraints". 

## Where are the "real" problems?

You are wearing different hats! You are a member of several communities and organizations. 
Talk to people in your circles and uptake a real problem people actually have. 
Indeed, there are many software applications out there. 
Yet, people constantly look for better, faster and smarter ways to accomplish everyday tasks. 
And fortunately for us software engineers, there are still lots of rooms for improvements in existing 
software products (as well as many novel ones to be built).
