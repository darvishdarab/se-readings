# Client Application

Aside from listing desired functionalities/features, we also need to sketch out how the user will interact with our software.
To that aim, we typically build a [Mockup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockup) or sketch out a **wireframe**.

:::info
There are many free and proprietary tools out there to create mockups and/or wireframes. [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) is a great proprietary writeframing tool. You really don't need a software for this! Keep it simple and use **paper & pencil** but feel free to leverage more powerful tools like [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/), etc. You may also find free ones like [mydraft.cc](https://mydraft.cc/), [wireframe.cc](https://mydraft.cc/), or [pencil project](https://pencil.evolus.vn/) useful.
