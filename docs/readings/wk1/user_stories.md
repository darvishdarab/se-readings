One of the most widely used ways of capturing requirements
in a format that's useful for engineers and customers are _user stories_.
The user stories are short concrete documents
that capture who a feature is for, what its value is,
and how long it will take to build.

User stories are written in a format called the **role-goal-benefit**:

```plain
As a <type of user>, I want <some goal or objective> so that <benefit/value>
```

The role-goal-benefit forces the customer/developer to really think about who is going to benefit from a feature, what they're trying to achieve, and why they want to achieve that.
By capturing a feature (functional requirement) in such a concrete way, it
gives everyone an opportunity to really think about whether or not
a feature is really worthwhile and adds real concrete value to a product.

:::tip
When we're thinking about user stories it's important not to feel constrained too much by the process.
One place that people find this constraining is in terms of role-goal-benefit. The role for our user stories don't always have to be human entities. They can also be back-end systems, third party servers, and other systems.

## User story checklist
Getting user stories right is often
challenging, especially for newcomers.
Here is a set of guidelines to help you write
effective user stories:

* Keep them short, simple and independent from one another.
* Write from the perspective of the user.
* Make the value/benefit of the story clear - what is the reason for the story?
* Describe one piece of functionality. If you must, break it into more stories
* Write stories as a team.
