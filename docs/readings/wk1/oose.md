Object-Oriented Software Engineering (or as we like to call it, OOSE) is a course about developing software that others can understand, maintain, and grow. The course goals include improving your ability to:

* Elegantly implement larger-scale software systems.
* Work effectively with a team of programmers.
* Think independently and innovatively.
* Communicate your ideas, designs, and implementations.

## What do we do in OOSE?

You form groups of 6-7 students and work on a project of your choosing throughout the course. There are one or two weekly "project-meeting" sessions for you to work on your project. A staff member advises your group, helping you along the way and reviewing your progress.

In parallel with working on your project, you must attend lecture sessions and complete the corresponding reading assignments as well as a number of homeworks. Through these, we discuss the principles discovered by software engineers over decades of practice, such as design patterns, refactoring techniques, and so forth. Moreover, we will help you to get started with the tools and technologies that you need to develop software. These are best learned by doing the homework (and employing them in your project). Once the lectures and homeworks are done, you will take a *comprehensive* individual quiz to further solidify and assess your understanding of the taught topics. In the later half of the semester, there will be no lectures/readings/homeworks so that you can focus completely on your project work.
