CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete, refering to the four basic operations we perform on data stored in a database. Almost all internet consumer-related software uses CRUD; you use it every time you ask an application to take your new data or modify the existing one. In the context of the [Mybooks App](mybooksapp) application:

* **Create:** This would consist of a function which we would call to create and store a new book in the database.
* **Read:** This would consist of a function which would be called to see all (or a subset) of stored books.
* **Update** A function to call to make changes to an already existing book.
* **Delete**: A function to call to remove an already existing book.

CRUD often corresponds to the HTTP methods POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE, respectively.
