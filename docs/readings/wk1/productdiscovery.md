Step one in building your software project is to understand what its requirements are. This process is called Product Discovery.

:::info Functional Requirement
A (functional) requirement is a single thing that the software has to do.
:::

For example, here is a functional requirement for MyBooks App: The app allows adding new book entries and it keeps a record of them (i.e., stores them in a Database).

In addition to functional requirements, you should consider non-functional requirements.

:::info Non-Functional Requirement
Non-functional requirements define how a system is supposed to be whereas functional requirements define what a system is supposed to do.
:::

For example, here is a non-functional requirement for MyBooks App: The system should be [highly available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability_software). If the service is down, even briefly, a user may not be able to see the list of all saved books.

Here is another one: The app's user interface must be [user friendly and easy to use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability).

If you are pursuing the "entrepreneur track," product discovery will be a harder task. Software projects involving several people start with very different impressions on how the end product will need to be. Your primary goal during product discovery is to expand on and unify those visions into one cohesive vision. This happens through extensive discussing, questioning, sketching, ......... among all parties involved: management, developers, customers, etc.

:::info Stakeholders
Developers, investors, customers, managers, ........., any person with a specific interest in and knowledge of the software product to be specified.
:::

During product discovery, you must speak with all the stakeholders and involve them in defining the software requirements.

:::tip 
Product Discovery results in "software requirement specification."
