[OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) is a lightweight http client Java library. As you already saw, [Postman](postman) serves the same purpose as a stand-alone tool, but you  may leverage `OkHttp` in your java program to send http requests and collect the results that the servers sends back. 

## Using OkHttp

Add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file to be able to make use of `OkHttp`:

```groovy
implementation 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.9.1'
```
