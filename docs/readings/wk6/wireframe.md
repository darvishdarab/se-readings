# Website Wireframe

A wireframe is a two-dimensional illustration of a page's interface that specifically focuses on space allocation and prioritization of content, functionalities available, and intended behaviors. For these reasons, wireframes typically do not include any styling, color, or graphics.


"A website wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe)


Aside from listing desired functionalities/features as user stories, we also need to sketch out how the user will interact with our software to use those functionalities/features. To that aim, we typically build a [Mockup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockup) or sketch out a **wireframe**. 


:::info
There are many free and proprietary tools out there to create mockups and/or wireframes. [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) is a great proprietary writeframing tool. You really don't need a software for this! Keep it simple and use **paper & pencil** but feel free to leverage more powerful tools like [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/), etc. You may also find free ones like [mydraft.cc](https://mydraft.cc/), [wireframe.cc](https://mydraft.cc/), or [pencil project](https://pencil.evolus.vn/) useful.
